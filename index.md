## Introduction

## Modelling

Modelling soft robots is a problematic task as many simulation softwares are unable to realistically mimic the properties of soft, flexible materials. For this project, a soft robotic limb is modeled in simulation before learning algorithms can be tested on it. To achieve realistic results it is important that the software used has certain properties; for example, the ability to accurately model soft materials and the ability to use it to test the machine learning models.

A software called SOFA (Simulation Open Framework Architecture) which is primarily used in simulation in medical fields has a soft robotics plugin which can be used to achieve the task at hand. Several tutorials can be found online on Youtube and some documentation is also included with the software when it is downloaded.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/esmeralday/esmeralday.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/esmeralday/esmeralday.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
